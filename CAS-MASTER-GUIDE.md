## Your Unfair Advantage (Read This Every Morning)

You are not a typical executive job seeker. You have:

- **$100M+ revenue track record** — grew ventures from scratch. Not a projection. A fact.
- **National distribution DNA** — Wolseley Canada, the country's largest HVAC/R distributor. You led national sales strategy.
- **CCO-level execution** — P&L ownership, SAP S/4HANA, HubSpot, full commercial function
- **Multilingual** — English, Romanian, Bulgarian, French — rare in the Canadian industrial market
- **Sustainability credentials** — Environmental designation (Vienna 1992), USGBC, circular economy expertise — ahead of the curve
- **Published thought leader** — 9 LinkedIn articles, 4K followers, credibility that compounds

**Most CCO/VP Sales candidates have results OR credibility. You have both.**

## Your Core Pitch (Memorize This — One Version for Every Conversation)

> *"I'm a transformational commercial executive with 20+ years in industrial distribution —
> national HVAC/R at Wolseley, building materials distribution across Central Europe, and
> CCO-level P&L ownership. I've grown businesses from zero to $100M+ in revenue.
> I'm looking for my next President or CCO role where I can do it again."*

Use this on LinkedIn, in interviews, in networking calls. Same message, every time.
Consistency builds recognition. Recognition builds momentum.

2. *"How does the board/ownership measure the success of this role?"*
3. *"What happened to the last person in this seat, and what would they have done differently?"*
4. *"What's the biggest untapped revenue opportunity you see right now?"*
