## Version 1: President / General Manager

**[Date]**

**[Hiring Manager Name]**  
**[Title]**  
**[Company Name]**  
**[City, Province]**

Dear [Name],

I turned a loss-making operation profitable in 9 months. Then I grew EBITDA by 137% in the 8 months after that.

That is what I did at Toromont CAT (TSX: TIH) as General Manager — and it is the kind of work I am built for. I am writing to express my interest in the President role at [Company Name].

My career has been defined by taking commercial organizations that are underperforming relative to their potential and systematically rebuilding them. At Wolseley Canada — the $1.3B subsidiary of Ferguson Plc (NYSE: FERG) — I led 130 sales reps and 16 managers to deliver a 12% national revenue increase, adding $40M above budget. At Thermon Heating Systems (NYSE: THR), I ran global sales across North America, EMEA, APAC, and Russia, growing revenue by 24.3%. At C.R. Laurence / Oldcastle BuildingEnvelope, I managed a $70M Canadian P&L, delivered 650 basis points of net profit improvement, and hit 118% of sales plan in my first full fiscal year.

Earlier in my career, I built Arabesque Bulgaria from a zero-revenue greenfield to $38 million in revenue in two years — 7,000+ clients, 120+ employees, and a full SAP ERP implementation. Starting from nothing is not something most executives have done. I have done it twice, including my current role as CCO of Samsar Resources LLC, where I am building the commercial infrastructure for a circularity-as-a-service business focused on Li-ion battery repurposing.

What I bring to a President role at [Company Name]:

- **Full P&L accountability** across businesses ranging from $70M to $1.3B in scope
- **Revenue growth in every assignment** — double-digit increases at Thermon, Wolseley, Toromont, and Arabesque
- **Operational credibility** — I fix margin problems, not just top-line problems
- **Team building at scale** — from hiring a first salesperson to managing 130-rep national organizations
- **Technology adoption** — drove 93% CRM adoption across 130 reps in 10 months; deployed MS Dynamics + Power BI at a NYSE-listed company

I am based in Toronto, targeting GTA hybrid or North America remote arrangements, and am seeking total compensation in the $300,000+ range.

I would welcome a conversation about what you are building and where my track record fits. I will follow up within the week, or you can reach me directly at 647-467-2277.

Respectfully,

## Version 2: CCO / Chief Commercial Officer

**[Date]**

**[Hiring Manager Name]**  
**[Title]**  
**[Company Name]**  
**[City, Province]**

Dear [Name],

The hardest commercial problem is not maintaining growth. It is building the infrastructure, the team, and the discipline that makes growth repeatable. That is what I do.

I am Casian Glavce, and I am interested in the Chief Commercial Officer role at [Company Name].

At Wolseley Canada, I inherited a national sales organization of 130 reps and 16 managers. In three years, I increased national revenue by 12% — $40M above budget — and drove 93% CRM adoption across the entire team in 10 months. Wolseley is the $1.3B Canadian subsidiary of Ferguson Plc (NYSE: FERG). Scale, complexity, and accountability came with the territory.

Before that, as Director of Global Sales at Thermon Heating Systems (NYSE: THR), I owned commercial performance across North America, EMEA, APAC, and Russia — four geographies, one P&L outcome. I delivered 24.3% revenue growth and rebuilt the CRM and analytics stack using MS Dynamics and Power BI. The data infrastructure I built was not a technology project; it was a commercial leverage tool.

At C.R. Laurence / Oldcastle BuildingEnvelope, I turned a $70M Canadian region into a margin improvement story — 650 basis points of net profit improvement while hitting 118% of the FY21 sales plan. Revenue and margin at the same time is the job.

The through-line of my career: I have grown revenue in every role, improved margins in every P&L assignment, and built commercial organizations that outlast my tenure. I have done it inside NYSE and TSX listed companies, and I have done it from greenfield — I built Arabesque Bulgaria from $0 to $38M in 2 years with 120 employees and 7,000+ clients.

As CCO of Samsar Resources LLC, I am currently doing it again — taking a pre-revenue circularity-as-a-service company to its first commercial deployments in the Li-ion battery repurposing space.

For [Company Name], I am most interested in [specific opportunity — customize per application]. I believe my track record in [relevant sector] and my experience with [specific capability] maps directly to what you need.

I am based in Toronto, targeting $300,000+ total compensation, and am open to GTA hybrid or North America remote.

I would welcome 20 minutes to discuss your commercial priorities and where my experience is most relevant.

## Version 3: VP Sales

**[Date]**

**[Hiring Manager Name]**  
**[Title]**  
**[Company Name]**  
**[City, Province]**

Dear [Name],

I have managed $40M above-budget revenue gains. I have built 130-rep national sales teams. I have driven 93% CRM adoption in 10 months. I am interested in your VP Sales opportunity.

I am Casian Glavce — a Toronto-based sales leader with a career defined by building high-performance teams and delivering growth that exceeds plan. Here is why I think the VP Sales role at [Company Name] is a match:

**I build sales teams that perform at scale.** At Wolseley Canada (the $1.3B subsidiary of Ferguson Plc, NYSE: FERG), I led 16 sales managers and 130 representatives across Canada. We increased national revenue by 12% — $40M above the budget target — in a mature, competitive distribution market. That kind of growth on a $1.3B base does not happen without process, accountability, and the right people in the right seats.

**I know how to grow revenue in complex markets.** At Thermon Heating Systems (NYSE: THR), I ran global sales across four geographies — North America, EMEA, APAC, and Russia. Revenue grew 24.3%. I did not do it by working harder; I rebuilt the go-to-market approach and the data infrastructure (MS Dynamics CRM + Power BI) to make the team more effective.

**I have done the turnaround.** At Toromont CAT (TSX: TIH), I stepped into a General Manager role with a loss-making business. Nine months later it was profitable. Eight months after that, revenue was up 33% and EBITDA had grown 137%. Turnarounds require a different kind of sales leadership — one that combines urgency with precision.

**I have built from zero.** At Arabesque Bulgaria, I built a $0 to $38M revenue operation in 2 years. 120 employees. 7,000+ clients. That experience gives me credibility that purely enterprise-trained sales leaders lack.

I am currently CCO at Samsar Resources LLC, building the commercial function for a circularity-as-a-service company focused on Li-ion battery repurposing from a pre-revenue baseline.

I am targeting total compensation of $300,000+ and am based in Toronto with flexibility for GTA hybrid or North America remote. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss your sales organization's current priorities and what success looks like in this role.

Please reach me at 647-467-2277 or casianglavce@gmail.com.
