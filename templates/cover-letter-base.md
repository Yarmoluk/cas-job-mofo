## Version A: President / General Manager

```
[Date]

Dear [Hiring Manager Name or "Hiring Committee"],

[Company]'s position as [a leading HVAC distributor / industrial equipment supplier /
fast-growing distribution business] caught my attention — particularly [specific recent
news: acquisition, expansion, new product line].

I'm Casian Glavce, and I've spent 20+ years building and running commercial organizations
at the intersection of industrial distribution, HVAC/R, building materials, and sustainability
markets. At Wolseley Canada, I led national sales strategy. Before that, I grew a distribution
business from scratch to $100M+ in annual revenue as Country Manager across Central Europe.

What I bring to [Company]:
• The ability to define and execute a commercial strategy — and hold the team accountable to it
• Deep understanding of distribution economics, channel management, and customer acquisition
• Operational discipline: ERP and CRM implementation (SAP S/4HANA, HubSpot), P&L ownership
• Leadership that builds cultures of accountability, not compliance

I'm not looking to collect a title. I'm looking to take a strong business and make it market-leading.

I'd welcome a conversation.

## Version B: Chief Commercial Officer / Chief Revenue Officer

```
[Date]

Dear [Name],

Revenue growth is not a marketing problem. It's a commercial leadership problem — and it's
one I've been solving for 20+ years.

As CCO at Samsar Resources and former Director of Sales Operations at Wolseley Canada
(national HVAC/R distribution), I've built commercial engines from the ground up:
sales teams, CRM infrastructure, pricing strategy, channel development, and P&L management.

The result: ventures scaled to $100M+ in annual revenue. National operations optimized.
High-performance cultures built that outlast the person who built them.

For the [Role Title] role at [Company], I bring:
• Commercial strategy that translates to pipeline and closed revenue — not just plans
• Hands-on CRM/ERP implementation (I've run HubSpot and SAP S/4HANA deployments)
• Distribution channel expertise that is rare at the C-suite level
• A track record of restructuring and realigning commercial teams for acceleration

I'm seeking a role where commercial leadership means something — where I own the number
and have the authority to execute.

If [Company] is building for growth, I'd like to be part of that conversation.

## Version C: VP Sales (High-Growth Company)

```
[Date]

Dear [Name],

Your VP Sales posting at [Company] aligns with exactly the kind of problem I've built
a career solving: how to take a strong product and build the commercial machine that
turns it into dominant market share.

I've done this in industrial distribution, HVAC/R, and building materials — markets where
relationships are long-cycle, technical fluency matters, and execution discipline separates
the leaders from the also-rans.

At Wolseley Canada, I led national sales strategy across one of Canada's largest HVAC/R
distribution networks. Before that, I scaled a distribution business to $100M+ as Country
Manager. Today, as CCO at Samsar Resources, I own the full commercial function.

What I'd bring to [Company]:
• A defined sales process — not vibes, but a repeatable system
• CRM built to track, forecast, and coach — not just report
• A team development philosophy: I build reps who become leaders
• The urgency of someone who has grown businesses from scratch and knows what it costs to miss a quarter

I'm targeting VP Sales roles in companies that are serious about commercial performance.
Is [Company] one of those?
