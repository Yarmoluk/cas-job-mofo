**Subject:** Commercial Executive — $1.3B P&L Scope, Turnaround Track Record | President/CCO/CRO Roles

Dear [Recruiter Name / Team],

I am reaching out to introduce myself as an active candidate for President, CCO, CRO, or VP Sales mandates at the $300K+ total compensation level.

I am Casian Glavce, a Toronto-based commercial executive with a consistent record of revenue growth and P&L transformation across NYSE and TSX listed companies, PE-backed businesses, and greenfield markets.

**Three numbers that define my track record:**

- **137% EBITDA growth in 8 months** and a loss-making operation turned profitable in 9 months as General Manager at Toromont CAT (TSX: TIH)
- **+$40M above budget** — 12% national revenue increase as National Director of Sales overseeing 130 reps and 16 managers at Wolseley Canada, the $1.3B subsidiary of Ferguson Plc (NYSE: FERG)
- **$0 to $38M in 2 years** building Arabesque Bulgaria from pre-revenue to a 7,000+ client, 120-employee operation within a $600M+ company

Additional highlights:

- **24.3% revenue growth** as Director of Global Sales at Thermon Heating Systems (NYSE: THR) across NA, EMEA, APAC, and Russia, with full CRM and Power BI infrastructure deployment
- **650 bps net profit improvement** and 118% of sales plan FY21 as VP of Canada at C.R. Laurence / Oldcastle BuildingEnvelope, managing a $70M regional P&L
- Currently serving as **CCO of Samsar Resources LLC**, driving the commercial build of a circularity-as-a-service platform focused on Li-ion battery repurposing — from pre-revenue to first commercial deployments

My sectors include industrial / process heating, heavy equipment, wholesale distribution, building products, and sustainability/clean tech. I have operated in North America, EMEA, APAC, Russia, and Eastern Europe.

**What I am targeting:**
- President, CCO, CRO, or VP Sales
- $300,000+ total compensation (base + variable)
- GTA hybrid or North America remote
- Mid-market growth companies ($50M–$500M), PE-backed businesses, or public companies

I am happy to provide a resume, reference contacts, and a brief call at your convenience. I am selective and focused — I am not applying everywhere. I am approaching firms I respect with mandates that match this profile.

Thank you for your time.

**Subject:** Following Up — Casian Glavce | President/CCO/CRO Candidate

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my note from [date]. I am still actively looking and wanted to make sure my profile was on your radar for any President, CCO, CRO, or VP Sales mandates.

Quick refresher: Toronto-based, $300K+ target, GTA hybrid or remote. Last three roles were at NYSE: THR (Thermon), NYSE: FERG subsidiary (Wolseley Canada, $1.3B scope), and TSX: TIH (Toromont CAT). Consistent P&L improvement and revenue growth track record across each.

Happy to send a resume or jump on a 15-minute call this week if that is easier. Let me know what works.

## PE Firm Version (for PE-Backed Portfolio Company Searches)

**Subject:** Commercial Executive for Portfolio Company Mandates — P&L Turnaround Experience | Toronto

Dear [Name],

I am reaching out because I have a track record that fits the profile PE firms typically need when a portfolio company requires commercial transformation or accelerated revenue growth.

At Toromont CAT, I took a loss-making operation to profitability in 9 months and grew EBITDA by 137% in 8 months. At C.R. Laurence / Oldcastle, I delivered 650 bps of net profit improvement and 118% of sales plan in the first fiscal year. I have done this at public companies (NYSE: THR, NYSE: FERG subsidiary, TSX: TIH) and built from greenfield ($0 to $38M in 2 years at Arabesque Bulgaria).

I understand the 3–5 year PE hold period, EBITDA targets, and what it takes to build a management team that can survive a due diligence process. I am looking for a President, CCO, or CRO role at a PE-backed mid-market company in the $50M–$500M revenue range.

$300K+ total comp target. GTA hybrid or NA remote.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation to see if there is a fit with any current or upcoming mandates?
