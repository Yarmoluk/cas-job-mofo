## Template 1: Cold Outreach to CEO / Founder

**Use when:** CEO of a target company, no mutual connection, no open role posted

---

**Connection Request Note (300 char max):**

Hi [Name] — I have been following [Company] and am impressed by [specific thing — growth, market position, recent announcement]. I am a Toronto-based CCO/President-level executive actively exploring my next chapter. Would welcome a brief conversation if the timing ever makes sense.

---

**Follow-Up Message (after connection accepted):**

Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting. I will be direct about why I reached out.

I am Casian Glavce — I have spent the last 20+ years in commercial leadership roles at companies like Thermon Heating Systems (NYSE: THR), Wolseley Canada ($1.3B subsidiary of Ferguson Plc), and Toromont CAT (TSX: TIH). My track record includes a 24.3% global revenue increase at Thermon, $40M above budget at Wolseley, and a 137% EBITDA turnaround at Toromont in 8 months.

I am currently CCO at Samsar Resources, where I have taken the company from pre-revenue to its first commercial deployments.

I am not spray-and-praying. I am having targeted conversations with leaders I respect. If [Company] ever needs a commercial executive at the President, CCO, or VP Sales level — or if you know someone who does — I would appreciate 15 minutes.

No pressure. Happy to share more context if helpful.

Best,

## Template 2: Follow-Up After No Response (7–10 Days)

**Use when:** CEO/founder accepted connection but has not responded to initial message

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note from last week. I know your inbox is full.

Short version: I am a Toronto-based P&L executive with a consistent track record of double-digit revenue growth. Most recently Director of Global Sales at Thermon NYSE: THR (24.3% revenue increase) and National Director of Sales at Wolseley Canada — $1.3B scope, 130 reps, +$40M above budget.

I am exploring President, CCO, and CRO roles at growth-stage or PE-backed companies in the $50M–$500M range.

If there is a fit at [Company] or someone you think I should know, I would appreciate the connection. If not, no worries at all — I appreciate the time either way.

## Template 3: Response to a Posted Role

**Use when:** Company has posted a President, CCO, CRO, or VP Sales role on LinkedIn

---

**Connection Request Note:**

Hi [Name] — I saw [Company] is hiring a [Role Title] and wanted to connect directly. I am a Toronto-based commercial executive with P&L turnaround and revenue growth experience at Thermon NYSE:THR, Wolseley/Ferguson NYSE:FERG, and Toromont TSX:TIH. Happy to share more.

---

**Follow-Up / InMail:**

Hi [Name],

I applied for the [Role Title] position at [Company] and wanted to reach out directly — applications disappear into ATS systems and I would rather have a real conversation.

Why I think I am worth a call:

I have been in commercial leadership for 20+ years across industrial, distribution, and energy sectors. At Thermon Heating Systems (NYSE: THR), I grew global revenue 24.3% as Director of Global Sales covering NA, EMEA, APAC, and Russia. At Wolseley Canada (a $1.3B Ferguson Plc subsidiary), I led 130 reps and 16 managers to add $40M above revenue budget. At Toromont CAT (TSX: TIH), I turned a loss-making division profitable in 9 months and grew EBITDA 137% in 8 months.

I am based in Toronto and targeting $300K+ total comp with GTA hybrid flexibility.

Would a 20-minute call this week work? I can work around your schedule.

## Template 4: PE Firm Principal / Partner

**Use when:** Reaching out to a private equity firm that may have relevant portfolio companies

---

**Connection Request Note:**

Hi [Name] — I am a Toronto-based CCO/President-level executive with P&L turnaround and commercial build experience. I work with PE-backed companies and would value connecting with [Firm Name]'s network.

---

**Follow-Up Message:**

Hi [Name],

I am Casian Glavce — a Toronto-based commercial executive with a record that typically fits what PE firms need when a portfolio company requires a commercial overhaul or accelerated revenue growth.

The relevant data points:

- Turned a loss-making operation profitable in 9 months at Toromont CAT (TSX: TIH); grew EBITDA 137% in 8 months
- 650 bps net profit improvement + 118% of sales plan at C.R. Laurence / Oldcastle BuildingEnvelope ($70M Canadian P&L)
- 12% national revenue growth on a $1.3B base at Wolseley Canada (Ferguson Plc subsidiary) — $40M above budget
- Built $0 → $38M at Arabesque Bulgaria in 2 years; 7,000+ clients, 120 employees

I understand PE-backed timelines, EBITDA targets, and what it takes to build a commercial organization that holds up through a diligence process.

I am targeting President, CCO, or CRO roles at portfolio companies in the $50M–$500M revenue range. $300K+ total comp. GTA hybrid or NA remote.

If any current or upcoming mandates fit that profile, I would welcome a 15-minute conversation.

## Template 5: Referral Request (from existing connection)

**Use when:** Asking a current LinkedIn connection to refer you to someone at a target company

---

Hi [Name],

I hope things are going well with [Company / recent thing you know about them].

I am actively looking for my next role — President, CCO, or VP Sales at a mid-market growth company. I have been building a short list of companies where I think my background is relevant, and [Target Company] is on it.

I noticed you are connected to [Specific Person at Target Company]. Would you be comfortable making a warm introduction? Even a brief note saying we have crossed paths would go a long way.

Background on me if it helps your intro: I am a Toronto-based commercial exec, most recently CCO at Samsar Resources (Li-ion circularity). Before that: Director of Global Sales at Thermon NYSE: THR (24.3% revenue growth), National Director at Wolseley Canada ($1.3B scope, +$40M above budget), and GM at Toromont CAT (losses → profit in 9 months, 137% EBITDA growth).

I appreciate you considering it — no obligation either way. Happy to return the favour anytime.

## Usage Notes

- **Always personalize** the `[specific thing]` reference before sending Template 1 — a generic connection request reads as spam
- **Template 3** should only go out after confirming the actual hiring manager or decision-maker identity — do not send to an HR generalist
- **Template 5** — wait until you actually have the referral conversation in person or by phone before sending the written request; this message is a follow-up confirmer, not a cold ask
- **Template 6** — respond within 24 hours to recruiter inbound; speed signals seriousness without desperation
- **Character count:** LinkedIn connection request notes are capped at 300 characters. Templates marked "300 char max" should be counted before sending.
