# Account Penetration Playbook — Cas Glavce
## How to Attack Every Opportunity Like a Sales Professional

---

## The Core Principle
Cas IS a sales executive. Treat getting this job like selling a $300K enterprise deal.
Pipeline management. Multi-threading. Follow-up cadence. Never single-threaded.

---

## Step 1: Intelligence Gathering (Before Any Application or Outreach)

**For every company you target, answer these in 20 minutes:**

1. **Revenue & growth:** Is the company growing? Recent acquisitions? New markets?
2. **Who's the buyer?** CEO → hires President. Board → hires CEO. PE firm → hires CCO.
3. **What's the pain?** Flat revenue? Lost market share? New verticals? M&A integration?
4. **LinkedIn map:** Who are the key executives? Any recent departures in commercial roles?
5. **News search:** `[Company] "VP Sales" OR "CCO" OR "commercial" site:linkedin.com`

**Your pitch must say:** "I solve the specific problem you have right now."

## Step 2: Multi-Threading the Account

Never rely on one contact. Always find 3+ people:

| Contact | Why | Message Angle |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| CEO / President | Ultimate decision maker | Revenue growth partner |
| PE/Board member | Controls the mandate | Commercial transformation |
| Existing VP Sales | Potential future colleague | Peer intro, stay warm |
| HR / CHRO | Manages the process | Express interest formally |
| Recruiter on role | Controls access | Optimize your fit narrative |

**Rule:** If you're only talking to one person at a company, you're single-threaded and at risk.

## Step 3: The 5-Touch Sequence (Per Opportunity)

| Touch | Channel | Content | Goal |
|-------|---------|---------|------|
| 1 | LinkedIn connection | Short, specific, no ask | Get connected |
| 2 | Email (if available) | Full intro + CV | Express interest |
| 3 | LinkedIn message (Day 5) | Reference email + add value | Stay top of mind |
| 4 | Comment on CEO post | Thoughtful, relevant insight | Visible without being pushy |
| 5 | Follow-up email (Day 14) | New insight or news hook | Trigger a response |

**After Touch 5 with no response:** Move to passive tracking. Check every 30 days.

---

## Step 4: The Fit Narrative Framework

For every role, customize your pitch to answer ONE question the hiring manager has:
**"Why are you the best person to solve our specific commercial problem?"**

### Industrial Distribution Company
> "I've spent 20+ years in industrial distribution — nationally at Wolseley, then as CCO at Samsar. I understand how to build sales teams, drive margin, and build digital/CRM infrastructure that distribution businesses typically lack. I've done it before and I can do it for you."

### HVAC / Building Products
> "Wolseley Canada is one of the country's largest HVAC/R distributors. I led national sales strategy there. I know your customer, your channel, your seasonality. This isn't adjacent experience — it's direct."

### Renewable Energy / Cleantech
> "My sustainability credentials go back to 1992. Combined with $100M+ commercial track record, I bring both the environmental credibility and the execution muscle that most executives in this space lack. I bridge the gap between mission and revenue."

### Capital Equipment
> "Complex capital sales require long-cycle relationship management, technical fluency, and distribution channel expertise. I've built all three. My industrial distribution background gives me an edge — I understand the equipment buyer AND the distributor who sells it."

### PE-Backed Company (any sector)
> "PE-backed businesses need commercial leaders who move fast, own the number, and build for exit. That's my track record. I've restructured sales organizations, implemented CRM, and accelerated revenue on compressed timelines."

## Step 5: Interview Playbook

**Before every interview:**
- [ ] Read company's last 3 press releases
- [ ] Find the CEO's LinkedIn and recent posts — know their priorities
- [ ] Review Glassdoor reviews — understand culture and potential red flags
- [ ] Prepare 3 STAR stories (Situation, Task, Action, Result) with specific numbers

**Power questions to ask (signals executive presence):**
1. "What does commercial success look like here in 18 months — and what's in the way of achieving it?"
2. "How does the board or ownership measure the success of this role?"
3. "What happened to the last person in this seat — and what would they have done differently?"
4. "What's the biggest untapped revenue opportunity you see right now?"

**Compensation negotiation rule:** Never give a number first. When asked:
> "Based on my experience and the scope of this role, I'm targeting $300K+ total compensation —
> with an emphasis on base. I'm flexible on structure if the opportunity is the right fit."

---

## Step 6: Closing the Offer

**When you get an offer:**
1. **Do not accept on the spot.** Say: "I'm very excited about this. Can I have 48 hours to review the full package?"
2. **Get everything in writing** before you respond
3. **Counter on 3 elements minimum:** base, variable, start date (and ideally signing bonus)
4. **Use competing interest** (real or implied): "I'm in late stages with another company, so timing matters to me."
5. **Final move:** Ask for a one-time signing bonus if base won't move: "I'd be willing to accept [base] with a $30K signing bonus to bridge the gap."
