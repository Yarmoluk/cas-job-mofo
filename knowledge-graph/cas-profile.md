## Weaknesses to Address Proactively

- Recent role (Samsar Resources) is smaller company — position as "intentional step to execute full commercial ownership"
- Academic credential is Eastern European (Galati/Lower Danube) — compensate with results-led narrative
- No Canadian C-suite title yet — CCO at Samsar + Wolseley national role bridges this gap
