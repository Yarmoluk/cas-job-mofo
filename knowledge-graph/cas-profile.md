## Key Differentiators

1. **Repeatable revenue performance across industries.** Not a one-sector specialist — has delivered double-digit revenue growth in industrial heating, equipment, distribution, building products, and greenfield markets.

2. **P&L turnaround track record.** Toromont CAT: losses to profit in 9 months, +137% EBITDA in 8 months. Not theoretical — operational, with measurable proof.

3. **Greenfield builder.** Most executives manage existing revenue. Casian has built $0 → $38M (Arabesque) and driven a company from pre-revenue to first commercial deployments (Samsar). This is rare at C-suite level.

4. **CRM/data infrastructure credibility.** Drove 93% CRM adoption at scale (130 reps, 10 months) and deployed MS Dynamics + Power BI at a NYSE-listed company. Bridges commercial strategy and revenue operations.

5. **Multi-geography fluency.** Has operated commercially in North America, EMEA, APAC, Russia, and Eastern Europe — understands distributed sales leadership without cultural blind spots.

6. **Public company experience.** Has operated inside NYSE (Thermon, Ferguson/Wolseley, Open Text) and TSX (Toromont) listed companies — understands board-level accountability, investor scrutiny, and compliance culture.
