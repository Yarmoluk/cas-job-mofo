## Scoring a Job Opportunity (use this to prioritize your time)

Score each opportunity 1–5 on:
- Industry fit (industrial, distribution, HVAC, cap equip, renewables, circular)
- Role fit (President/CCO/CRO/VP Sales)
- Company size ($50M–$1B revenue is ideal)
- Compensation signal (use Glassdoor / Levels.fyi to estimate)
- Location (GTA hybrid = max, fully remote = good, relocation required = low)
- Network connection (warm intro available = +2 bonus points)

**Score 20+ = apply same day**
**Score 15–19 = apply within 48 hours**
**Score below 15 = skip or low priority**

## The 3 Channels That Will Get Cas His Job

1. **Executive Recruiters** (40% probability) — retained search firms fill 60% of C-suite roles before they're posted publicly. Get on their radar BEFORE they have a role. Send intro emails THIS WEEK.

2. **Direct Outreach to CEOs/PE Firms** (35% probability) — most executive hires come from networks. A compelling 3-sentence LinkedIn message to a CEO of a $100M distribution company can trigger "we weren't looking but we should be."

3. **Job Postings** (25% probability) — still worth doing, but often means competition. Use for P1 opportunities only; move fast (apply within 24 hours of alert).
