## Negotiation Principles for Cas

### Never disclose compensation history
> "I'm focused on what the role is worth based on scope and market — not what I've earned before."

### When asked for a number first
> "Based on my research and the scope of this role, I'm targeting $300K+ in total compensation,
> with a strong preference for base. I'm flexible on structure if the opportunity is the right fit."

### When an offer comes in below target
> "I appreciate the offer and I'm genuinely excited about this opportunity.
> The base is a bit below where I need to land. Can we get to $[X]?
> That would make this an easy yes for me."

### The "split the difference" counter
> "I understand there may be constraints. Could we meet at $[midpoint]?
> I can make that work if everything else holds."

### When base won't move
> "If the base is firm at $[X], would you be open to a $30–40K signing bonus to bridge the gap?
> That's a one-time cost for you and makes the total package work for me."

## PE-Backed Company Equity Negotiation

PE-owned companies (especially in industrial distribution) often include:
- **Management equity:** 0.5–3% of company equity (ask for this)
- **Phantom equity / profit-sharing:** If no direct equity available
- **Carried interest:** At growth equity firms

**Ask:** "Is there a management equity program for senior executives?"
If yes: ask for vesting schedule, valuation basis, exit mechanics.
